* Created a **Decision Tree** algorithm that estimates the best Drug (accuracy score **98%**) for patients given Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Sodium to Potassium Ratio.
* **Pre-Processed** the data and converted categorical values into dummy/indicator variables.
* Split the data with a **Test Size** of 0.3.
* Optimized the Decision Tree with an **Entropy** criterion and a **Max Depth** of 4 to obtain the best model.
* Plotted the **Model Results**.
